<h1>What is this?</h1>
It's my attempt to get residents in Crabtree, West Sussex to apply for government funding to improve our broadband.

<h2>Who are you?</h2>
I'm Jack. I live in Mill Lane and am fairly dependent on the internet for work.

<h2>How fast will it be?</h2>
It depends how much you want to pay per month once it's installed. As a rough guide, ~150 mbit/sec (something like 5x our "average" speed) currently costs around £30 per month. ~900 mbit/sec is around £60 per month.

<h2>Who's paying for this?</h2>
The <a href="https://gigabitvoucher.culture.gov.uk/">government</a>, if we sign up enough elligible properties. There's a grant of anywhere between £1000-3000 per property depending on how many properties
sign up.

<h2>How long will it take?</h2>
Rough lead times are around a year after ordering. That's a realistic but worst-case estimate.

<h2>What’s the catch?</h2>
<p>There's no obligation to do or change anything <i>until</i> we place an order</p>
<p>
Once we proceed to ordering, in order to receive a grant,
you have to agree to sign up for a 12 month contract with an FTTP provider.
This also has to be at least twice as fast as your current connection,
or at least 30 mbit/sec download (whichever is faster).

<a href="provider.html">Here</a> is a page on finding available packages.
</p>


<h2>Don’t we already have fibre?</h2>
<p>
No. We have fibre to the cabinet, then copper/aluminium lines from there to our properties.
This is often misleadingly described as “fibre”, but it’s much slower and is less reliable.
</p>

<h2>What about phone lines?</h2>
<p>
Openreach are currently installing hybrid copper &amp; fibre lines so you will be able to keep
existing telephone equipment if this is important to you. You should be aware the copper telephone
network is expected to be switched off by 2025 anyway.
</p>

<h2>Is this the best possible internet access in the UK?</h2>
<p>
No, not really. It’s asymmetric, so download is faster than upload, and other wholesale
providers are using more advanced technology. I’ve chosen Openreach because they will offer
the greatest access to (cheaper) ISPs, and because they are very likely to be around in 20 years.
I’m not so sure about some of the Alternative Network providers. It seemed like the best trade-off for domestic properties.
</p>

<h2>Will this fix my WiFi?</h2>
No. This will only get faster speeds to your router. See <a href="wifi.html">here</a> for information on WiFi.

<h2>Why should I sign up?</h2>
The more properties that do sign up for the voucher scheme, the greater the chance this will be funded in its entirety.

<h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
Email <a href="mailto:crabtree.broadband@gmail.com">me</a> including <b>at least</b> your postal address, and preferably your name.

<h2>Please leave me alone</h2>
Sorry. If you email me and ask me not to talk to you again (with your postal address, sorry), I'll add you to a list and try really hard to never bother you again. In any case I'll be using that email address only for this purpose, and I won't share your data with anyone, beyond Openreach and the gov.uk
voucher scheme.

<h2>Do I know you?</h2>
Maybe. You might have seen me being dragged about by spaniels.
