<h1>Broadband providers</h1>

<p>
Most broadband providers are a bit like electricity suppliers, and they take a
service from a wholesaler (in this case Openreach), package it up and re-sell
it to you at a small profit.
</p>
<p>
It's a pretty low-margin business, and most providers at the cheaper end of
the market have cut costs with customer service, and they're all pretty much
the same.
</p>
<p>
This difference gets more apparent if you have a problem with your internet
service, but hopefully it's less likely a newly-installed FTTP line will 
encounter any problems!
</p>

<h2>The Cheapest</h2>
<p>
The cheapest I could find at the moment by searching
<a href="https://www.thinkbroadband.com/packages/fttp-broadband">ThinkBroadband's package list</a> which fulfills the conditions is Vodafone's Superfast 100 at £26 per month, or TalkTalk's Fibre 150 package at around £30 per month.
</p>
<p>
In order to be eligible for the voucher, you need to check this will be at
least twice as fast as your current speed (and TalkTalk's will be).
</p>


<h2>Better options</h2>
<p>
Paying for more and better staff to give decent customer service costs money.
If you’re looking for actually good customer service
then <a href="https://www.zen.co.uk/">Zen</a>, <a href="https://www.idnet.com/">IDNet</a> or
<a href="https://www.aa.net.uk/">Andrews &amp; Arnold</a> (for the geeks) are highly recommended.
</p>

<h2>Finding your own</h2>
<p>
You can ask any ISP for their prices, as long as they provide service over
Openreach's FTTP network (almost all of them do). However, you can't check your
eligibility or costs right now, because our postcodes haven't had FTTP installed. You can use one of the addresses in Horsham (say RH12 1EP) as an example
address to get prices.
