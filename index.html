<h2>What’s the catch?</h2>
<p>
Once we proceed to ordering, in order to receive a grant,
you have to agree to sign up for a 12 month contract with an FTTP provider.
This also has to be at least twice as fast as your current connection,
or at least 30 mbit/sec download (whichever is faster).
</p>
<p>
As an example, the cheapest package I could find which gave 145 mbit/sec was just under £30 per month,
but most ISPs are like electricity suppliers, and you are often best off swapping when out of contract
anyway if you’re looking for the cheapest option. If you’re looking for actually good customer service
then <a href="https://www.zen.co.uk/">Zen</a>, <a href="https://www.idnet.com/">IDNet</a> or
<a href="https://www.aa.net.uk/">Andrews &amp; Arnold</a> (for the geeks) are highly recommended.

<h2>Don’t we already have fibre?</h2>
<p>
No. We have fibre to the cabinet, then copper/aluminium lines from there to our properties.
This is often misleadingly described as “fibre”, but it’s much slower and is less reliable.
</p>

<h2>What about phone lines?</h2>
<p>
Openreach are currently installing hybrid copper &amp; fibre lines so you will be able to keep
existing telephone equipment if this is important to you. You should be aware the copper telephone
network is expected to be switched off by 2025 anyway.
</p>

<h2>Is this the best possible internet access in the UK?</h2>
<p>
No, not really. It’s asymmetric, so download is faster than upload, and other wholesale
providers are using more advanced technology. I’ve chosen Openreach because they will offer
the greatest access to (cheaper) ISPs, and because they are very likely to be around in 20 years.
I’m not so sure about some of the Alternative Network providers.
</p>

<h2>Will this fix my WiFi?</h2>
No. This will only get faster speeds to your router. It will not affect the performance of the WiFi (radio) in your property.
This is usually solved by using Mesh WiFi devices, such as the TP-Link Deco Devices. I specifically do not recommend
buying any kind of "whole home" guaranteed system which requires a monthly fee; you're better off buying the equipment outright.
