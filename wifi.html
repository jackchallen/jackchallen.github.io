<h1>WiFi vs Broadband</h1>
<p>
Many people confuse "WiFi" with any "Internet Access".
WiFi only covers the short hops within your home, whereas improving broadband (by installing FTTP) will only get you better speeds to your router.
Most people will use WiFi (small low-powered radio links) to get from their router to e.g. their phones &amp; TVs.
</p>

<h2>The best WiFi</h2>
<p>
The best WiFi is no WiFi at all. If you can, use a network cable to connect whatever you're using to the router. This cuts out distance and interference problems immediately, and is
extremely effective for getting internet access to an outbuilding.
<br />
It does have the small problem of having to run more cables, however.
</p>

<h2>The second best WiFi</h2>
<p>
If you can run cables to e.g. your loft, you can get extremely good results by mounting dedicated high-performance WiFi access points, with cabling direct to them. Most houses will get really good results
with 1 or 2 of these. TP-Link's Omada range, or the UBNT Unifi range are extremely good choices.
</p>

<h2>The third best WiFi</h2>
<p>
A reasonable trade-off for most people is to disable the WiFi on whatever cheap router the ISP has given you, and use meshing WiFi Access points, like TP-Link's Deco range. These connect to each other wirelessly and don't require
cabling round the house. They give you one single WiFi network to join and spread the network around the house.
</p>

<h2>What about WiFi extenders</h2>
Don't use them. They're all junk.

<h2>What about my ISP's "whole home" guarantee?</h2>
It's a rip-off. It charges you a monthly fee to rent equipment you can buy outright yourself, and which you can then use with whichever ISP you choose. Avoid.

<h2>Is this page wrong?</h2>
Yes, technically it is. I've massively over-simplified things.
